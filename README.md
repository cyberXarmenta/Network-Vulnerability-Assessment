<h1>Network Vulnerability Assessment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Here I will be completing a basic network vulnerability assessment on a newly built office from “RockStar Corp”.    

I will complete several steps in order to analyze a corporation's network and then provide a summary of my findings. This vulnerability assessment assignment involves:

- Commands used to complete the tasks such as <b>fping</b>, <b>nslookup</b> & <b>nmap</b>.
- Subnetting.
- A summary of my findings.
- The OSI layer(s) my findings involve.
- Recommended mitigation strategy.
- TCP SYN scans.
- Ports and protocols.
- SSH into servers.
- DNS cache poisoning.
- PCAP analysis.
- ARP spoofing (MINTM)



<h2>Scenario</h2>
I'm a Network Security Analyst at RockStar Corporation conducting a network vulnerability assessment.
RockStar Corp has recently built a new office in Hollywood, California. These are RockStar Corps concerns: 

- RockStar Corp doesn't want any of their servers, even if they are up, to indicate that they are accepting connections.
- RockStar Corp recently reported that they are unable to access rollingstone.com in the Hollywood office. Sometimes when they try to access the website, a different, unusual website comes up.
- RockStar Corp is also concerned that an adversary may have infiltrated their Hollywood office. (The adversary also left a note about where she stored some packet captures).
